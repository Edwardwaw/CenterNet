# CenterNet
This is an unofficial pytorch implementation of CenterNet in a more elegant way. some parts of code in this repo is  based on 

[CenterNet-better]: https://github.com/FateScript/CenterNet-better

. 

## requirement
```text
tqdm
pyyaml
numpy
opencv-python
pycocotools
torch >= 1.5
torchvision >=0.6.0
mmcv-full==1.2.2
```
## result
we trained this repo on 8 GPUs with batch size 128(16 image per node).the total epoch is 140, Adam with cosine lr decay is used for optimizing.
finally, this repo achieves 33.3 mAp at 512px resolution with resnet50 backbone without any augmentation.

## training
for now we only support coco detection data.
